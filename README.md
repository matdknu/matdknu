Hello everybody 👋

Here you will find my workplace (sometimes public or private) 💻

My name is Matias Deneken, I am a sociologist, Master in Sociology and Master in Data Science and Innovation. 
I am currently working in the areas of intercultural relations and justification of social violence.
Throughout my work experience, I have been in charge of handling, processing and analyzing different sources of information, from text mining to longitudinal surveys. 
My areas of interest are social psychology and computational social science. Currently, I am specializing in natural language processing and design of experiments.

I am also a Fulbright scholar and will start my PhD in approximately 2027 🔜🇺🇸

I am a user of the R programming language and Python 🐍.
