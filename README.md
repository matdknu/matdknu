Hello everybody 👋

Here you will find my workplace (sometimes public or private) 💻

My name is Matias Deneken, I am a sociologist, Master in Sociology and Master in Data Science and Innovation. 
I am currently working in the areas of intercultural relations,  justification of social violence and political discourse. Throughout my work experience, I have been in charge of handling, processing and analyzing different sources of information, from text mining to longitudinal surveys. Currently, I am specializing in natural language processing and design of experiments.

My areas of interest are social psychology and computational social science. 

I am a user of the R programming language and Python 🐍.

I am also a Fulbright scholar and will start my PhD in approximately 2027 🔜🇺🇸
